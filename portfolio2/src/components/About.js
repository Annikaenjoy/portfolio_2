              Hi! I'm Annika. I'm a frontend developer located in Mosj√∏en,
              Norway. I love combining code with good UX/UI and great design.
            </h3>{" "}
            <p>
              My interest in coding started back in 2010 creating blog themes
              with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but it wasn't until 2019 I decided
              to turn my hobby into a career. In March 2020 I started studying
              Frontend Development at Noroff School of Technology and Digital
              Media, and I could not be happier. <br /> <br />A year into my
              studies I got a job as a Frontend Developer in a startup company,
              creating our own products and helping various clients build their
              digital brand and identity. I'm currently on maternity leave, but
              will start my new job as a webdeveloper for Riktig Spor in august.{" "}
              <br /> <br />
              Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
              {/* Today I have the priviledge of working as a Frontend Developer
                  in a startup company, being there every step of the way
                  building our own products and helping various clients build
                  their digital brand and identity. Here you can check out some
                  of the websites I've created. */}
